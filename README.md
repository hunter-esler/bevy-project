This was just a random project to help learn Rust, Bevy, and just to pass the time. So far it has about a day of work.

It creates 2d "Bodies" that orbit around a "Sun" using a very basic implementation of n body algorithm. It brought to my attention the hurdles a lot of space games had to cross, such as floating point errors and how to deal with massive scale in video games. 

Bevy also requires you to think much differently than just OOO. The ECS system has a lot to offer and may be interesting and fun to work with.
